# Navigation Manager for Android
A Helper library for easy navigation between fragments.

# Installation:

1. Add this to your Project level build.gradle file:

```gradle
allprojects {

    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
2. Add this to your dependencies in your App level build.gradle file:


```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "com.github.tamimattafi.android-navigation-manager:basic:$latest_version"
}
```

3. **OPTIONAL**

3.1. Implementing the core module
   
> This should only be included if you want to extend the core functionality in a different direction.
> This must be included if you want to override transaction animations.
   
```gradle
dependencies {
   implementation "com.github.tamimattafi.android-navigation-manager:core:$latest_version"
}
```

3.2. **Dagger Support**
> This module has support for dagger support injectors.
> It has the same functionality as the basic module so choosing one of them depends on your project requirements.
> Why not both? It is possible to use both modules alongside each other!
>
> **NOTE**
> Using navigation provided by this module requires you to provide an instance of DaggerNavigator.
> In your ActivityModule, you must implement a binder/provider for this type.


```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "com.github.tamimattafi.android-navigation-manager:dagger:$latest_version"
}
```

# Docs
The code is well documented. A quick reading [here](https://github.com/tamimattafi/android-navigation-manager/blob/master/core/src/main/kotlin/com/tamimattafi/navigation/core/NavigationContract.kt) would make everything clear to you!


# Happy coding!
